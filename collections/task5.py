# TASK: Waiter Helper

# Rationale: To practice lists
# Script should act like a waiter at a restaurant taking orders

# level 1

# Greet the user

# Print a list of starters

# Take an input for the user for their starter

# Print a list of mains

# Take an input for the user for their main course

# Print a list of desserts

# Take an input for the user for their dessert

# Print all of the user's choices

# level 2
# Use at least one f-string
# Add each item ordered to a list called 'customer_order_list'

# if time: level 3 (may need research if we have not covered dictionaries yet)
# Use dictionaries and assign prices to the items. Create a bill at the end of the program.

# if time: level 4
# Add more to this program. Recommended ways are: Only allow input that is within the list, Add quantities of order etc.
