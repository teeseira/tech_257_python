# TASK: Write a 'Hero story' Python script

story1 = {
    "start": "It was summer time,",
    "middle": "but then it started raining.",
    "end": "Welcome to London!"
}

# Print the entire dictionary
print("The story: \n", story1)

# Print the type of your dictionary
print("Type of dictionary:", type(story1))

# Print only the keys
print("The keys only:\n", story1.keys())

# Print only the values
print("The values only:\n", story1.values())

# Print the individual values using the keys (individually, lots of print commands)
print("\nValues of each key individually:")
print("Start: ", story1["start"])
print("Middle: ", story1["middle"])
print("End: ", story1["end"])

story1.append["hero":"yourSuperHero"]

'''
Now, let's add a new key:value pair:
'hero': yourSuperHero
Hints:
If time
Improve the program. For example, can you make it a "Choose your own adventure" story?
